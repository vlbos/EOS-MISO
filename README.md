# EOS Milestone Initial Security Offering

> A sample escrow contract responsible for managing share value and fund release based on project milestones, governed by the current share holders.

The Milestone ICO is designed to supplement payment to developers for work completed, while protecting investors from projects with no intent.

### Investor Registration
For this we are not going to allow accounts to preregister. The reason being is that our ICO contract is responsible for covering the funds for wallet storage, so we will be required to withhold the RAM for accounts who have not purchased any tokens.

## Share Terms
> Not all shares are created equal!

### Voting rights
Shares may or may not have the right to vote on entity ballots. In the case where the terms grant voting rights, the tier value will be used to determine the weight of each vote.

### Preference
> Entitlement to capital on winding up
In the case of insolvency, investors are entitled to their proportioanl share of the entities remaining capital. This value will be distributed based up on the preference ranking found in the terms of each particular share.
