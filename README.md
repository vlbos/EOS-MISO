# EOS Milestone Initial Security Offering

> A sample escrow contract responsible for managing share value and fund release based on project milestones, governed by the current share holders.

The Milestone ICO is designed to supplement payment to developers for work completed, while protecting investors from projects with no intent.

### Investor Registration
For this we are not going to allow accounts to preregister. The reason being is that our ICO contract is responsible for covering the funds for wallet storage, so we will be required to withhold the RAM for accounts who have not purchased any tokens.
